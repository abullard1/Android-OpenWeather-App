# Android-OpenWeather-App
A small Android weather app I made in Q1 2022 using Java as part of some university coursework. The code might seem a little unnecessarily complex, as at the time I was still newly learning how to make Android Apps and wasnt familiar or well versed with the concepts of fragments and Room Databases.
