# Android-Weather-App
A small Android weather app I made in Q1 2022 using Java as part of some university coursework. The code might seem a little unnecessarily complex, as at the time I was still 
newly learning how to make Android Apps and wasnt familiar or well versed with the concepts of fragments and Room Databases which is why everything happens in a single activity
and by enabling/disabling visibility of elements and by saving local data in SharedPreferences using Google GSON.

## Usage
To run the App, either download and install the provided .apk file onto your android mobile phone or open the Weather App Folder as a new folder in Anndroid Studio.
